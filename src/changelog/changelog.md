# Changelog

## 2025-02-17

- added design system with design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, shadows, radii, z-index, transitions) in `src/styles/tokens.css`
- installed tailwind v4 on top of CSS — `@theme` block bridges tokens into tailwind utilities so both systems share the same values
- fixed global resets (`* { padding: 0 }`) overriding tailwind utilities by wrapping them in `@layer base`
- added ThemeProvider using `useSyncExternalStore` for localStorage + matchMedia subscriptions — defaults to OS preference, allows manual override, persists choice
- added ThemeToggle component
- created accessible UI primitives: Button (4 variants, 3 sizes, loading state), Input (label association, error/helper text, aria-describedby), Modal (portal, focus trap, escape/backdrop dismiss, scroll lock, focus restoration)
- added `/thoughts/styling` page explaining the styling decisions, trade-offs, and live component demos

## 2025-02-10

- added CSP headers in proxy.ts with per-request nonces for inline scripts, locked everything else down to same-origin
- layout.tsx reads the nonce from request headers so we can tag scripts with it
- set up postcss with autoprefixer
- styled protected page, use page.module.css as well as a specific module css for it
- created reusable components

## 2025-02-10

- added auth0 login/logout to the homepage using `@auth0/nextjs-auth0`
- created `src/lib/auth0.ts` for the auth0 client and `src/proxy.ts` to handle the auth routes
- main layout.tsx to use Auth0Provider and page.tsx and show login/logout depending on if you're signed in
- added route protection in proxy.ts so you get redirected to login if you try to hit any page besides the homepage without being logged in
- created some reusable components for main page and protected page
